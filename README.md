Driver Drowsiness Detection using ESP32cam,FTDI connector 
🚗 Driver Drowsiness Detection using ESP32-CAM

A real-time driver safety system built using ESP32-CAM to detect closed eyes / drowsiness and trigger alerts. The ESP32-CAM is programmed using FTDI connector and uses Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR) or image processing for detection.
📸 Hardware Used

ESP32-CAM (AI Thinker)

FTDI USB-to-TTL Programmer

Jumper wires

Power Supply 5V

(Optional) Buzzer / LED / Mobile Alert Integration
